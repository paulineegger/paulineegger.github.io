<h1>Week One</h1>
<p>Chapter One: Objects and Classes</p>

<p>Exercise 1.2: moveDown twice moves the circle in the separate window down twice, a third time moves it down again. If I call makeInvisible twice, the first time it becomes invisible and the second time nothing changes.</p>

<p>Exercise 1.3: To move the circle 70 pixels to the left using moveHorizontal, you make the value negative; -70.</p>

<p>Exercise 1.5: Colors that are not supported turn the circle black.</p>

<p>Exercise 1.6: Error: cannot find symbol - variable blue</p>

<p>Exercise 1.9: First I erased the previous shapes. To start on the picture, I created two circles, I named one “Sun” and the other “Grass” and also made two people, all of them visible. Then I turned the Sun circle yellow and the Grass circle green. I moved the green circle down to the bottom moveVertical, then moved the yellow circle over a bit with moveHorizontal, and adjusted their sizes with changeSize. I moved one person to the left and kept the other person where they were, then adjusted person2 to be a bit smaller. Lastly, I adjusted each piece to be the correct size and in the correct place.</p>

<p>Exercise 1.14: I think the Picture class draws the picture by using the Square, Triangle, and Circle classes and then moves them around and colors them to create the house picture.</p>

<p>Exercise 1.16, 1.17: sun.changeColor("blue");</p>

<p>sun2.changeColor("yellow");</p>
<p>sun2.moveHorizontal(-200);</p>
<p>sun2.moveVertical(-40);</p>
<p>sun2.changeSize(80);</p>
<p>sun2.makeVisible();</p>


          
<p>Exercise 1.24: numberofStudents shows the current number of students enrolled in the class and at the moment that is zero.</p>

<p>Exercise 1.27, 1.29:</p>
