<h1>Week One</h1>
<p>Chapter One: Objects and Classes

Exercise 1.2: moveDown twice moves the circle in the separate window down twice, a third time moves it down again. If I call makeInvisible twice, the first time it becomes invisible and the second time nothing changes.

Exercise 1.3: To move the circle 70 pixels to the left using moveHorizontal, you make the value negative; -70.

Exercise 1.5: Colors that are not supported turn the circle black.

Exercise 1.6: Error: cannot find symbol - variable blue

Exercise 1.9: First I erased the previous shapes. To start on the picture, I created two circles, I named one “Sun” and the other “Grass” and also made two people, all of them visible. Then I turned the Sun circle yellow and the Grass circle green. I moved the green circle down to the bottom moveVertical, then moved the yellow circle over a bit with moveHorizontal, and adjusted their sizes with changeSize. I moved one person to the left and kept the other person where they were, then adjusted person2 to be a bit smaller. Lastly, I adjusted each piece to be the correct size and in the correct place.

Exercise 1.14: I think the Picture class draws the picture by using the Square, Triangle, and Circle classes and then moves them around and colors them to create the house picture.

Exercise 1.16, 1.17: sun.changeColor("blue");

sun2.changeColor("yellow");
sun2.moveHorizontal(-200);
sun2.moveVertical(-40);
sun2.changeSize(80);
sun2.makeVisible();
